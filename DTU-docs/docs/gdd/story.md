This is a generation who is coming of age in an era of mass shootings in schools, a global pandemic, and turbocharged political turmoil. These things will invariably take their toll on young people, and all people.

Some believed that humanity would emerge better from COVID-19. It in fact came out worse. More differences than similarities were highlighted among families and friends. Society became more polarized than ever, both politically and ideologically.

Modern neoliberalism pushes humans to an ever worsening state of life: Prices increase as never before, jobs disappear and those that are still available pay less and less, forcing workers into ever-worsening work conditions, until these workers break down and are forced to commodify their lives as never before: Selling bodily pictures online. Taking odd jobs as Uber drivers. The list goes on. Everybody is a business owner now! Isn't it great? Who cares, your business is to sell feet pics on the internet. You are an *entrepreneur* now. You've *won!*.

# Okay, seriously now, are you an edgy millennial?

Yes. Probably. But also, "Drizzle: The Unveiling" (DTU) is an Action/Adventure digital Role Playing Game (CRPG) set in the modern post-COVID late-stage capitalism hellscape world of 2024 except there are supernatural monsters that lurk in the shadows of our society. These monsters are forced to do horrible things to survive, and often control and enforce the practices observed throughout the world. This shadow society works hard to keep itself hidden from prying eyes, so it can continue to exist and exert is self-interested plans on the world. And before you ask, yes. This *is* an allegory to capitalism (sorry, Tolkien).

More specifically, DTU takes place in [Drizzle City](wiki/drizzle_city.md). Even more specifically, in [Drizzle City Municipal University (DCMU)](wiki/dcmu.md), in the year of 2024, in the world described in the previous section. This world is full of dubious, self-interested characters with ulterior motives, disillusioned youth and greedy seniors. There is danger in every corner, both from the late stage capitalist society and from shadow monsters you didn't even believe were real.

Our characters are  edgy millennials attending various courses in DCMU. The twist is that these millennials are *vampires*. Clinically, they are dead: they don't breathe, blink, eat or drink. Their hearts don't beat and they don't feel love. During the day, they lay comatose in their hideouts, hiding from the sun. During the night, ancient mysterious powers reanimate their corpses, and they gain sentience once more. Animated by these powers, they carry out their wills and ambitions in the shadowy society of the night, controlled by older and even worse vampires than themselves. They are used and manipulated, often without their knowledge, by these elders for their own selfish purposes. Thesee vampires are called the *[Puer Sanguinis](wiki/puer_sanguinis.md)*, due to their young age. Every night, our characters try to gain an advantage in the shadowy society of the night while also surviving the world of today.
