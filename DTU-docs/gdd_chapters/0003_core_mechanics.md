# Core Mechanics

DTU is an RPG. The underlying system mechanics will be based on the [Resistance Toolbox](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/254150), by Rowan Rook and Deckard.

## Character creation

Every DTU game starts by creating a character. To create a character the **PC** will choose:

1. Name
2. Avatar
3. Skills
4. Background
5. Vampiric Abilities

### Names

Players are free to name their character however they want. In this section, players can also choose their pronouns (the pronouns that will be used when other characters refer to the **PC**)

### Avatar

We will have 3 male and female avatars that players will be able to choose from. This limits the amount of art we need to produce for the game.

### Skills
Each skill has 3 levels with associated numeric values:

| Level | Description |
|:---:|:---:|
| 0 | Bad |
| 1 | Average |
| 2 | Good |

When creating a character, all skills start at level 0. Players get additional 9 *Character points* to spend on skills (see [Advancement](#Advancement) for more details).

The following is a table of skills and skill descriptions in the game

| Skill | Description |
|:---:|:---:|
| Charm | Be nice to others to get what you want |
| Flirt | Turn on, seduce and manipulate others using your sex appeal |
| Lie | Fabricate mistruths to convince others to do what you want |
| Hurt | Inflict damage on others, physically, mentally, socially or all three simultaneously |
| Mend | Repair all forms of damage |
| Defend | Guard yourself against all incoming forms of damage |
| Perceive | Notice details that others might miss |
| Deduce | Form conclusions from pieces of information. Apply logic. |
| Recall | Remember useful facts and pieces of information about people, places or clues discovered |


### Backgrounds

Backgrounds are specialized things that characters did before becoming vampires. Mechanically, these are *domains*, as described in the Resistance Toolbox. They can also be relevant during story moments.

| Domain | Description |
|:---:|:---|
| Low budget Influencer | You are the owner of a variety YouTube channel with a *modest* number of followers. Unfortunately, you think you are a Kardashian. |
| OnlyFans foot model | You earn some extra money from posting *spicy* feet pics online. |
| Manifestation coach | You have an Instagram account about the (not so ancient) art of *manifesting* things in your life by asking the universe for them. |
| Redpilled podcaster | You have a podcast about how to cultivate a true **REDPILL** lifestyle. So what if some snowflakes feel offended? |
| Twitter politician | You are able to produce the longest and most eloquent series of tweets on current events, delivering hot takes with the conviction of someone whoâ€™s just discovered Wikipedia. |
| Video essayist | You create 9h videos on subjects very few people are interested in order to prove a point that you saw on Reddit once and though it was interesting. |
| Tech Bro | When it comes to solving menial problems that no one cares about, you are a true *Disruptor*. You measure your success in lines of code and VC funding, and despite a questionable work-life balance, you are convinced you're just one all-nighter away from becoming the next tech messiah.|
