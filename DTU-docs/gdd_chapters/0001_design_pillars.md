# Design pillars

## Don't limit the player choice (DLPC)

If an action is reasonable, do not prevent the player from doing it, unless it is **absolutely** necessary due to technical constraints.

## Don't be the judge of the player's actions (DJPA)

Players can do *bad* things to others and to themselves, if they wish to. Don't discourage the player from being bad by making the "good" playthrough obviously preferred over the "bad" one by giving better choices or better conclusions. It is important to note that being bad (as well as being good) has an unavoidable set of positive and negative consequences that the player may not avoid. Example: If you kill character A and character B is very fond of A, B may no longer speak to you, or they try to get revenge on A's death.

## The three pathways of solution (3PS)

The game will provide *at least* three possible solutions to every problem:

1. Physical solution: Using your physical prowess to solve the problem
2. Mental solution: Using your intelligence to solve the problem.
3. Social solution: Using your social skills to solve the problem.

## Avoid adventure game puzzle logic (AAGPL)

The investigation should be challenging but logical. Adventure Game logic has no place in this game. Example: The player encounters a locked door. Applying [3PS](#the-three-pathways-of-solution), the player could:

1. Push the door open, punch a hole through the door.
2. Pick the lock, find the key, hack the digital locking mechanism.
3. Charm the guard into opening the door, get told a way to get around the door, convince the person on the other side to let you in.
