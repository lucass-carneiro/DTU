# Gameplay

## Objectives

The main objective of DTU will be to reach its narrative conclusion, which means to solve (or not) the mystery. In order to do that, players must obtain clues. Clues are obtained by investigating the physical environment and talking to NPCs. Once the player is ready they can form a conclusion. Conclusions unlock new dialogue options, new clues or new locations. The narrative conclusion will take the various player-NPC interactions into account by providing a summary of the consequences of their action (Tim Cane style end slides)

## Core Loop

During any given time, a DTU player will be doing one of the following

1. Walking to another location in campus.
2. Inspect a location for clues and interacting/inspecting physical elements.
3. Talking to the NPCs at a location.
4. Connecting clues to form new thoughts and conclusions in their Mind Palace.

## Primary mechanics

DTU is an RPG. The underlying system mechanics will be derived from the [Resistance Toolbox](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/254150), by Rowan Rook and Deckard. This makes DTU a Sparked By the Resistance game. The Toolbox will be used to create the core RPG mechanics underlying the investigative possibilities of the game (clue inspection and NPC interaction)

### Resistances

Resistances represent things characters have to lose and ways that they can be hurt. These are the resistances that the DTU PC will have:

| Resistance | Represents | Damage when |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Mind | Overall mental capacity and mental health. | Being demoralized, failing to complete a task, effects of other vampire’s powers. |
| Body | Overall physical well-being | Physically attacked, failed to maintain a proper blood diet. |
| Social | Overall social standing and dispositions | Upsetting others, being rude, performing actions that tarnish one’s reputation. |
| Blood | The preternatural force that sustains your undead body. | Damaged slowly overtime. Damaged more when using vampiric powers. The amount of damage is power dependent |

### Taking Stress

- Whenever something bad happens, the PC takes *Stress* to the appropriate resistance.
- The amount of stress to be taken fall into 1 of 3 categories.
- Determine in which severity category the stress taken should fall under according to the stakes of failing the action, then roll a die according to the table below

| Category | Die |
|:---:|:---:|
| Low | `1d3` |
| Moderate | `1d6` |
| Severe | `1d8` |

Add the value of the roll to the stress pool of the relevant resistance.

### Fallout

- Fallout is an ongoing serious effect that results from taking stress.
- When taking stress to a Resistance, roll `1d10`. If the roll is smaller than the amount of Stress in that Resistance, the PC will suffer Fallout according to the table below:

| Stress when `1d10` was rolled | Fallout category |
|:---:|:---:|
| 2-4 | Minor |
| 5-8 | Moderate |
| 9+ | Severe |

- Fallout is always added *only* to the Resistance that took stress and triggered the Fallout check.
- If Fallout occurs to a resistance that currently already has Fallout causes the existing status to be "upgraded" to the next category.
- When appropriate, a Severe Fallout can be turned into two Moderate ones.
- When appropriate, a Moderate Fallout can be turned into two Minor ones.

### Domains

In DTU, Domains will be player archetypes according to the table below:

| Domain | Description |
|:---:|:---|
| Low budget Influencer | You are the owner of a variety YouTube channel with a *modest* number of followers. Unfortunately, you think you are a Kardashian. |
| OnlyFans foot model | You earn some extra money from posting *spicy* feet pics online. |
| Manifestation coach | You have an Instagram account about the (not so ancient) art of *manifesting* things in your life by asking the universe for them. |
| Redpilled podcaster | You have a podcast about how to cultivate a true **REDPILL** lifestyle. So what if some snowflakes feel offended? |
| Psychology streamer | You twitch stream daily teaching people psychology techniques on how to ignore the societal collapse around them and practice *mindfulness* instead. |
| Video essayist | You create 9h videos on subjects very few people are interested in order to prove a point that you saw on Reddit once and though it was interesting. |
| New Language Enthusiast | You like messing around with computers and other electronic devices. The sad part is you are the person that keeps saying that others should use that new pre 1.0 programming language that has all the features they absolutely **want**, but their current language does not have. |

### Knacks

 If the PC has a Skill or Domain, and it is gained again, the PC can choose a *Knack*. A Knack is Mastery (see [Resolution](#Resolution)) in a particular facet of the broad area covered by a Domain.

### Advancement

These are the actions that lead the players to advance. Advancing means gaining an Experience point, which can be used to buy one of the abilities available to the player.

There are different categories for advancement, depending on the significance of a player action. See the table bellow:

| Category | Requirements | Rewards |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Small | Uncover a small clue. Extract a minor piece of information from an NPC | 1 point |
| Medium | Uncover an important clue. Extract an important piece of information from an NPC | 3 points |
| Large | Uncover a key piece of information. Extract key information from an NPC. Achieve a breakthrough in the case | 5 points |

Advancement points in the 1-5 range may also be dispensed upon completing side quests.

### Resolution

- If an action can fail to interesting narrative consequences, the PC rolls `1d10`.
- Add `1d10` if the player has a relevant skill for the action.
- Add `1d10` if the character has a relevant domain.
- Add `1d10` if the character has mastery. Mastery does not stack, that is, you can only add mastery once per action.

Players pick the highest result of the roll. Outcomes are determined according to the table below:

| Value | Result |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | Critical Failure (double stress) |
| 2-5 | Failure (take stress) |
| 6-7 | Costly success (take stress) |
| 8-9 | Success (no stress) |
| 10 | Critical success (inflict +1 stress for each 10 rolled if appropriate) |

- If the player is trying to inflict stress and rolled a 10, for each 10 rolled additional +1 stress is added to the total stress inflicted.
- If the player action consists of *only* trying to defend themselves from taking stress, stress is still taken if the dice result is smaller or equal to 7, but it is one die type lower than usual.

If an action is difficult, a number of dice are subtracted from the player roll, according to the table below

| Difficulty | Dice to subtract |
|:---:|:---|
| Standard | 0 |
| Challenging | 1 |
| Very Challenging | 2|

### Removing Stress

Characters can have Refresh Actions that remove stress

Taking Fallout reduces stress according to:
- Minor Fallout: 3 Stress
- Moderate Fallout: 5 Stress.
- Severe Fallout: 7 stress

Using ability to remove stress can be used to remove Fallout according to the table above

### Vampiric abilities

#### Blood Revenant

This is the passive ability that gives life to your undead body. All vampires possess this ability and cannot live without it. If the vampire no longer has blood to consume, this ability ceases to function, and they are permanently destroyed. This is game over.

|Tier | Stress cost |
|:---:|:---|
|1 |`1d4` to Blood every 15 real time minutes.|
|2 |`1d4` to Blood every 30 real time minutes.|
|3 |`1d4` to Blood every 60 real time minutes.|

#### Crimson Allure

Against mortals, this ability causes the vampire to perform any action that uses Charm to automatically succeed without rolling any dice. Against other vampires, see the tables bellow.

| Tier | Stress cost (humans) |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | `1d6` to Blood |
| 2 | `1d4` to Blood |
| 3 | 1 to Blood |

| Tier | Stress cost (vampires) | Effects |
|:---:|:---:|:---|
| 1 | `1d4` to Blood | Lower the difficulty of a Charm roll against a vampire by 1 |
| 2 | `1d6` to Blood | Lower the difficulty of a Charm roll against a vampire by 2 |
| 3 | `1d8` to Blood | Lower the difficulty of a Charm roll against a vampire by 2 and add `1d10` to the vampire's roll. |
