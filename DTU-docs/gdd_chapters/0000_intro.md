# Introduction and Overview

## What is this game?

"Drizzle: The Unveiling" (DTU) is a CRPG where you control a young vampire detective with paranormal abilities attempting to solve a crime in their university campus: Their own death and transformation into an undead creature. In order to do that, players will explore the college campus, consisting of several environments, where they will find clues and suspects. Players interact with the world by collecting objects, inspecting physical and environmental clues and talking to NPCs. This can be aided by their newfound vampiric powers. Once enough clues are collected, players can form conclusions and theories about their investigation in their Mind Palace. The game will not stop the player from forming wrong conclusions, nor will let the player know in advance which of their actions have long term consequences. This is intended to keep the player engaged and increase replayability.

## Why create this game?

1. I like vampires.
2. I like RPGs.
3. And thus, I like Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines (and VTM in general).
4. I also like detective stories and detective games.

Currently, the Urban Dark Fantasy Vampire RPG market is not delivering the kind of RPG stories and experience I want to play, so I decided to take it upon myself to create the game I would like to play with these elements. The hope is that other people that like the same stuff as I will also find this game interesting.

## Where does this game take place?

This game takes place in the fictional "Drizzle City", more specifically in "Drizzle City's Municipal University" (DCMU). Drizzle city is a sprawling metropolis showered by an almost constant drizzle that houses millions of a diverse set of people. It also suffers greatly from wealth disparity issues and other common large city problems. Drizzle city is heavily inspired in the city of SÃ£o Paulo, but it contains elements (and the dirty grittiness) of all major cities around the world. 

## What do I control?

You control a young college student that after a night of heavy partying gets turned into a newborn vampire (in this world often referred to as a *puer sanguinis*[^1] by some). You will soon discover that a sinister conspiracy linked to a series of ritualistic gruesome murders around campus are all linked to the night of your murder and subsequent transformation.

Your character posses inherent human skills but can also employ his newfound arsenal of bloody powers if the need arises. Furthermore, being a creature animated by the power of the blood it consumes, your character must constantly drink blood, otherwise they risk do be destroyed.

[^1]: *Puer Sanguinis* translates to "Child of Blood"

## What is the main focus?

In this game, the player is supposed to:

1. Learn who killed them and transformed them into a monster and why.
2. Learn how their death is linked to the string of gruesome deaths around campus.
3. Understand and learn how to navigate the complex secret vampiric society on the university campus.
4. Learn how to use and the limits of their newfound vampiric powers.
5. Keep your hunger and monstrous nature under control.


## What is different about this game?

This game's main aim is to provide the dark urban fantasy of vampiric and investigative gameplay to audiences that value aspects of CRPGs such as player choice, world responsiveness to player actions and engaging storytelling. Even tough games with similar themes and settings can be found in the modern market, I believe that they are all lacking in the RPG aspect, especially in allowing player freedom of choice and providing robust responsiveness to different character builds that are reflected in the game world. This game is an attempt to fix that.
