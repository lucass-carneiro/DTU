# Introduction and Overview

## Summary

"Drizzle: The Unveiling" (DTU) is a CRPG where you control a young detective with paranormal abilities attempting to solve a crime in their university campus. In order to do that, players will explore the college campus, consisting of several environments, where they will find clues and suspects. Players interact with the world by collecting objects, inspecting physical and environmental clues and talking to NPCs. Once enough clues are collected, players can form conclusions and theories about their investigation in their Mind Palace. The game will not stop the player from forming wrong conclusions, nor will let the player know in advance which of their actions have long term consequences. This is intended to keep the player engaged and increase replayability.

Being a CRPG, players are able to create different character builds with different skills. Players will be able to choose from mental, physical, social and paranormal skills to create a unique detective avatar that allows for greater role playing. The game supports these choices by making sure that all puzzles and challenges presented to the player are solvable in different ways. Player choices also play an important role in the development of the story. Choices are made through dialogue with NPCs and interactions with the world.

## Player experience

When playing "Drizzle: The Unveiling", players are expected to be mindful of their surroundings. Environments and NPCs contain clues, but getting to these clues may not always be straightforward. NPCs may lie, important environmental clues can be missed (or inaccessible due to lack of specific character skills). It will be important for players to reflect upon the events of the story during gameplay. The game should provide a sense of mystery intrigue, darkness and anxiety.


## Platform and Software

DTU will be a PC game, releasing for Windows and Linux. MacOS and mobile support may be considered in the future. The game will be developed on the custom SURGE engine. SURGE is a cross-platform (Windows and Linux) with custom OpenGL graphics abstractions. Vulkan support is planned, but may not be available by the time the game is released, thus the main render backend target is OpenGL.

## Genre

As previously stated, DTU is a detective CRPG with Dark Urban Fantasy and Horror elements and puzzles.

## Target audience

The ideal or typical DTU player is a classic CRPG fan who likes games such as BG3, VTMB, Disco Elysium, Planescape Torment, Fallout (1 and 2). As DTU is not heavily focused on tactical combat, as for instance B3 or Fallout, adventure game players with a taste for mysteries and puzzles may also enjoy the game, especially classic and modern Adventure Game fans. The game provides social commentary on modern western society as experienced by Millennials and Gen Zs, thus attracting these audiences with greater probability than other demographics or age ranges. This does not mean the game is not made for these audiences. Being an RPG featuring modern society elements, DTU will feature gender sex and pronouns on character creation, facilitating the Role Playing experience of these demographics. While some may be put off by this decision, this should not be considered to be "pandering", but merely a tool to give expression to those who wish to have it, while also being a thematically relevant element to the game's narrative.
