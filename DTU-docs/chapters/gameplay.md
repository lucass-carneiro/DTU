# Gameplay

## Objectives

The main objective of DTU will be to reach its narrative conclusion, which means to solve (or not) the mystery. In order to do that, players must obtain clues. Clues are obtained by investigating the physical environment and talking to NPCs. Once the player is ready they can form a conclusion. Conclusions unlock new dialogue options, new clues or new locations. The narrative conclusion will take the various player-NPC interactions into account by providing a summary of the consequences of their action (Tim Cane style end slides)

## Core Loop

During any given time, a DTU player will be doing one of the following

1. Walking to another location in campus.
2. Inspect a location for clues and interacting/inspecting physical elements.
3. Talking to the NPCs at a location.
4. Connecting clues to form new thoughts and conclusions in their Mind Palace.

## Primary mechanics

DTU is an RPG. The underlying system mechanics will be derived from the [Resistance Toolbox](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/254150), by Rowan Rook and Deckard. This makes DTU a Sparked By the Resistance game. The Toolbox will be used to create the core RPG mechanics underlying the investigative possibilities of the game (clue inspection and NPC interaction)
