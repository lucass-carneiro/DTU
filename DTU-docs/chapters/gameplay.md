# Gameplay and Concept

## Objectives

The main objective of DTU will be to reach its narrative conclusion, which means to solve (or not) the mystery. In order to do that, players must obtain clues. Clues are obtained by investigating the physical environment and talking to NPCs. Once the player is ready they can form a conclusion and accuse one of the suspects. This accusation can be met with approval or disapproval by the NPCs, producing a number of different endings.

## Core Loop

During any given time, a DTU player will be doing one of the following

1. Walking to another location in campus.
2. Inspect a location for clues and interacting/inspecting physical elements.
3. Talking to the NPCs at a location.
4. Connecting clues to form new thoughts and conclusions in their Mind Palace.
