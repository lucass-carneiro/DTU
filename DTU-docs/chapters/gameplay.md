# Gameplay and Concept

## Objectives

The main objective of DTU will be to reach its narrative conclusion, which means to solve (or not) the mystery. In order to do that, players must obtain clues. Clues are obtained by investigating the physical environment and talking to NPCs. Once the player is ready they can form a conclusion and accuse one of the suspects. This accusation can be met with approval or disapproval by the NPCs, producing a number of different endings.

## Core Loop

During any given time, a DTU player will be doing one of the following

1. Walking to another location in campus.
2. Inspect a location for clues and interacting/inspecting physical elements.
3. Talking to the NPCs at a location.
4. Connecting clues to form new thoughts and conclusions in their Mind Palace.

## Themes

A few motifs and concepts that permeate the game (literal or metaphorical)

- Mistrust
- Anxiety
- Uncertainty about the future

## Primary mechanics

DTU is an RPG. The underlying system mechanics will be derived from the [Resistance Toolbox](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/254150), by Rowan Rook and Deckard. This makes DTU a Sparked By the Resistance game. The Toolbox will be used to create the core RPG mechanics underlying the investigative possibilities of the game (clue inspection and NPC interaction)

### The Player

The DTU player character is a college freshman, recently arrived in Drizzle City, who discovers their paranormal abilities when a sinister crime has shaken campus life to its core. The player is driven to investigate this crime as it is closely related to the origin of their powers.
