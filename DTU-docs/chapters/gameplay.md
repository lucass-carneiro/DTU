# Gameplay

## Objectives

The main objective of DTU will be to reach its narrative conclusion, which means to solve (or not) the mystery. In order to do that, players must obtain clues. Clues are obtained by investigating the physical environment and talking to NPCs. Once the player is ready they can form a conclusion. Conclusions unlock new dialogue options, new clues or new locations. The narrative conclusion will take the various player-NPC interactions into account by providing a summary of the consequences of their action (Tim Cane style end slides)

## Core Loop

During any given time, a DTU player will be doing one of the following

1. Walking to another location in campus.
2. Inspect a location for clues and interacting/inspecting physical elements.
3. Talking to the NPCs at a location.
4. Connecting clues to form new thoughts and conclusions in their Mind Palace.

## Primary mechanics

DTU is an RPG. The underlying system mechanics will be derived from the [Resistance Toolbox](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/254150), by Rowan Rook and Deckard. This makes DTU a Sparked By the Resistance game. The Toolbox will be used to create the core RPG mechanics underlying the investigative possibilities of the game (clue inspection and NPC interaction)

### Resistances and Fallout

These are the resistances (according to the Resistance Toolbox) that the DTU PC will have:

| Resistance | Represents | Damage when |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Mind | Overall mental capacity and mental health. | Being demoralized, failing to complete a task, effects of other vampire’s powers. |
| Body | Overall physical well-being | Physically attacked, failed to maintain a proper blood diet. |
| Social | Overall social standing and dispositions | Upsetting others, being rude, performing actions that tarnish one’s reputation. |
| Blood | The preternatural force that sustains your undead body. | Damaged slowly overtime. Damaged more when using vampiric powers. The amount of damage is power dependent |

These are the possible Fallout states for each resistance

### Advancement

These are the actions that lead the players to advance. Advancing means gaining an ability point, which can be used to buy one of the abilities available to the player.

| Category | Requirements | Rewards |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Small | Uncover a small clue. Extract a minor piece of information from an NPC | 1 point |
| Medium | Uncover an important clue. Extract an important piece of information from an NPC | 3 points |
| Large | Uncover a key piece of information. Extract key information from an NPC. Achieve a breakthrough in the case | 5 points |

Advancement points in the 1-5 range may also be dispensed upon completing side quests.

### Skills and Domains

Skills inform the base actions that players take during gameplay. If attempting something that requires a roll, the PC gains `1d10` if they have the relevant skill for the action being attempted

The Domains are

| Domain | Description |
|:---:|:---|
| Low budget Influencer | You are the owner of a variety YouTube channel with a *modest* number of followers. Unfortunately, you think you are a Kardashian. |
| OnlyFans foot model | You earn some extra money from posting *spicy* feet pics online. |
| Manifestation coach | You have an Instagram account about the (not so ancient) art of *manifesting* things in your life by asking the universe for them. |
| Redpilled podcaster | You have a podcast about how to cultivate a true **REDPILL** lifestyle. So what if some snowflakes feel offended? |

The sad part is you are the person that keeps saying that others should use that new pre 1.0 programming language that has all the features they absolutely **want**, but their current language does not have. |

### Vampiric abilities

#### Blood Revenant

This is the passive ability that gives life to your undead body. All vampires possess this ability and cannot live without it. If the vampire no longer has blood to consume, this ability ceases to function, and they are permanently destroyed. This is game over.

|Tier | Stress cost |
|:---:|:---|
|1 |`1d4` to Blood every 15 real time minutes.|
|2 |`1d4` to Blood every 30 real time minutes.|
|3 |`1d4` to Blood every 60 real time minutes.|

#### Crimson Allure

Against mortals, this ability causes the vampire to perform any action that uses Charm to automatically succeed without rolling any dice. Against other vampires, see the tables bellow.

| Tier | Stress cost (humans) |
|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | `1d6` to Blood |
| 2 | `1d4` to Blood |
| 3 | 1 to Blood |

| Tier | Stress cost (vampires) | Effects |
|:---:|:---:|:---|
| 1 | `1d4` to Blood | Lower the difficulty of a Charm roll against a vampire by 1 |
| 2 | `1d6` to Blood | Lower the difficulty of a Charm roll against a vampire by 2 |
| 3 | `1d8` to Blood | Lower the difficulty of a Charm roll against a vampire by 2 and add `1d10` to the vampire's roll. |
